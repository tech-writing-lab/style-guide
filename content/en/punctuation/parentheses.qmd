# Parentheses

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/parentheses

Some of us love to use parentheses. Unfortunately, some readers ignore anything that appears in parentheses, so don't put important information in parentheses if you can help it.

Even for less important information, whenever you're inclined to use parentheses, consider whether they're necessary. Sometimes they are; however, the sentence or paragraph might work just as well if you remove the parentheses and set off the phrase or sentence by using commas, dashes, semicolons, or periods.

If you need to include parentheses in the middle of a sentence, keep the parenthetical thought short. Otherwise, consider using two sentences.

**Note**: If a full standalone sentence appears inside parentheses, the period also goes inside the parentheses, not outside.
