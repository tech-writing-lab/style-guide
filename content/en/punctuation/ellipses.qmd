# Ellipses

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/ellipses

In general, don't use ellipses. An ellipsis is made up of three contiguous periods. Ellipses indicate the omission of part of a sentence, paragraph, or larger block of text where the omission is not pertinent to the understanding of the subject at hand.

## Ellipses as suspension points

When ellipses are used to indicate hesitation, they are called *suspension points*. Don't use ellipses this way in our documentation.

## Ellipses in a user interface

When ellipses appear in a user interface, exclude them from the documentation describing the user interface unless their omission could cause confusion. For example, if the text on the button in the UI reads **Save ...**, document it as *click **Save***.

## Ellipses in text

Don't use ellipses in your written documentation; omit any unnecessary information and include all necessary information.

However, it's acceptable to use ellipses in quoted text (to replace a portion of the quoted text) except when they appear at the beginning or end of the text.

- ❌ Not recommended: My high school English teacher made me learn that Shakespeare quote: "All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players ...."

The previous example ended with four ellipsis points. The final ellipsis point is, in fact, a period. So when the material that you're omitting contains one or more sentence boundaries, use four dots instead of three.

## Punctuation and spacing of ellipses

Keep all three ellipsis points together. When creating an ellipsis, instead of the ellipsis character, use three periods in a row. Insert one space before and after the ellipsis unless a punctuation mark immediately follows the ellipsis; in this case, don't insert a space after the ellipsis.
