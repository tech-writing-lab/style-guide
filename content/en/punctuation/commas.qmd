# Commas

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/commas

Use commas to separate items in a series, and use commas to separate certain kinds of clauses.

## Serial commas

In a series of three or more items, use a comma before the final *and* or *or* to avoid potentially changing the meaning of the sentence. This comma is called a serial comma or an Oxford comma.

- ✅ Recommended: Locations are divided into zones, regions, and multi-regions.

- ❌ Not recommended: Locations are divided into zones, regions and multi-regions.

## Commas after introductory words and phrases

In general, place a comma after an introductory word or phrase.

- ✅ Recommended: Finally, only groups that contain parameters appear in this list.

- ✅ Recommended: Based on the requirements of your game, you can implement this method to update game information.

## Commas separating two independent clauses

When a coordinating conjunction (*and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *so*, or *yet*) separates two independent clauses, insert a comma after the first clause (before the conjunction) unless both clauses are very short.

- ✅ Recommended: The libraries make feed creation easier, and they ensure that only valid feeds are produced.

- ❌ Not recommended: The libraries make feed creation easier and they ensure that only valid feeds are produced.

- ✅ Recommended: Type your ID and click **OK**.

- ❌ Not recommended: Type your ID, and click **OK**.

## Commas separating independent from dependent clauses

When an independent clause and a dependent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, insert a comma *only if* the sentence could be misunderstood without one.

- ✅ Recommended: Direct-access flags are plain variables and can be read directly.

- ❌ Not recommended: Direct-access flags are plain variables, and can be read directly.

- ✅ Recommended: The manager acknowledged the last team member who entered the room, and started the meeting.

- ❌ Not recommended: The manager acknowledged the last team member who entered the room and started the meeting.

## Set off other kinds of clauses

It's often a good idea to set off certain kinds of clauses with a comma or other punctuation for clarity.

A couple of specific places where commas are a good idea:

- In general, put a comma before the word *which* at the start of a nonrestrictive clause. For more information about this topic, see this guide's section on [relative pronouns](https://developers.google.com/style/pronouns#relative-pronouns) and Grammar Girl's page on [*which* versus *that*](https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/articles/which-versus-that/).
- In general, put a semicolon or a period or a dash before a conjunctive adverb, such as *otherwise*, *however*, or *therefore*, and put a comma after the conjunctive adverb.

In general, don't use a comma before the causal conjunction *because* unless it starts a nonrestrictive clause. For more information, see the *Chicago Manual of Style* Q&A entry on [using commas with *because*](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Commas/faq0018.html).
