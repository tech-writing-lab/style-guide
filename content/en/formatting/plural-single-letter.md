# Pluralize a single letter

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/plural-single-letter

To form the plural of a single letter, italicize the letter and add an apostrophe followed by the unitalicized letter *s*.

- ✅ Recommended: We called tech support because the printer wasn't printing uppercase *B*'s or lowercase *p*'s.

- ✅ Recommended: If you still use a pen and paper, dotting your *i*'s is still necessary. Cross your *t*'s, too.

When the capitalization is irrelevant, use uppercase.

- ✅ Recommended: Mind your *P*'s and *Q*'s.
