# Use italics to discuss terms

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/italics-terms

This page describes two circumstances when we italicize terms that we're introducing or discussing.

For more information about italics and other formatting, including HTML and Markdown formatting for italics, see [Text-formatting summary](https://developers.google.com/style/text-formatting).

## New terms

When you introduce a new term that you're defining immediately, use italics on the first mention of the term. Don't use bold or quotation marks.

- ✅ Recommended: A *Clos network* is a kind of multistage circuit switching network.

## Words as words

When you refer to a word, phrase, or letter in reference to the word, phrase, or letter itself (sometimes called *words as words*) use italics. Don't use bold or quotation marks.

- ✅ Recommended: Don't use *&* (ampersand) as a conjunction. Use the word *and* instead.

- ✅ Recommended: To form a possessive of a singular noun, add *'s* to the end of the word.
