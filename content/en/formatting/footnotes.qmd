# Footnotes

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/footnotes

A footnote is an annotation with additional information usually provided at the end of a page, chapter, or book. We recommend avoiding footnotes because they aren't accessible and can present challenges for localization efforts.

Instead of a footnote, consider using the following formats to convey information:

- [Add a cross-reference](https://developers.google.com/style/cross-references).
- [Use a note](https://developers.google.com/style/notices).
- [Put it in a parenthetical](https://developers.google.com/style/parentheses).

If the only way to convey this information is to use a footnote, then use a superscript number—for example, `<sup>1</sup>`.
