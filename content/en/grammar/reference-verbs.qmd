# Verb forms in reference documentation

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/reference-verbs

When you're writing reference documentation for a method, phrase the main method description in terms of what the method does (*gets*, *lists*, *creates*, *searches*), rather than what the developer would use it to do (*get*, *list*, *create*, *search*).

It's a subtle distinction that manifests mostly in whether the initial verb in the description has an *-s* at the end or not.

- ✅ Recommended: tasks.insert: Creates a new task on the specified task list.

- ❌ Not recommended: tasks.insert: Create a new task on the specified task list.
