# Contractions

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/contractions

In general, we write our documentation in an [informal tone](https://developers.google.com/style/tone), so we recommend using common two-word contractions such as *you're*, *don't*, and *there's*.

## Negation contractions

In particular, we recommend using negation contractions such as *isn't*, *don't*, and *can't*. It's easy for a reader to miss the word *not* when they're scanning, whereas it's harder to misread *don't* as *do*.

If you need to emphasize the negative, you can use text formatting such as `is<em>not</em>`, which renders as "is *not*." But in most cases, you don't need emphasis to make your point clear.

## Contractions to avoid

Don't make up nonstandard contractions such as *guides're* or *browser's* (where *'s* means *is*).

Don't use three-word contractions such as *mightn't've*.
