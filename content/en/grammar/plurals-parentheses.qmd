# Plurals in parentheses

> Source: https://developers.google.com/style/plurals-parentheses

Don't put optional plurals in parentheses. Instead, use either plural or singular constructions and keep things consistent throughout your documentation. Choose what is most appropriate for your documentation and your audience. If it's important in a specific context to indicate both, use *one or more*.
